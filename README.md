I'm trying this thing known as Exploratory Data Analysis which is a basic building block of AI ML. Used Python. Ran Jupyter NB through VS Code. Took a dataset of various types of crimes and cleaned it (removed 
duplicate values, filled in missing values etc). In AI ML cleaning the data is the first step before you feed it to an AI model.
